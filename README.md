In this project, i tried to reproduce the paper "Prediction of antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli from large-scale pan-genome data" (given in the related works folder). As the title suggests, I predicted resistance of 1936 strains of E. Coli to 1 antibiotic using machine learning models. I examined population structure, isolation year, gene content,and polymorphism information as predictors. The machine learning models I applied were Gradient Boosted Decision trees and Logistic Regression.
